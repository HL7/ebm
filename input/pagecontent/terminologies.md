### Terminologies

The Scientific Evidence Code System (SEVCO) is an externally maintained terminology, copyright Scientific Knowledge Accelerator Foundation, published openly by Computable Publishing LLC.

The Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR Implementation Guide Code System and Recommendation Justification Code System are currently created within the EBMonFHIR IG. As this IG matures, it is the expectations that terms used will be moved in preferential order to:
- 1 SEVCO if they are relevant for SEVCO - the terminology development process for SEVCO is based on multidisciplinary consensus beyond the HL7 community
- 2 THO if they are relevant to the HL7 community beyond the EBMonFHIR IG
- 3 IG-based terminologies that mature
