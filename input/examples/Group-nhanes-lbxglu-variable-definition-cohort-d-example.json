Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase then converts the G-6-P to gluconate-6-P in the presence of NADP+. As the NADP+ is reduced to NADPH during this reaction, the resulting increase in absorbance at 340 nm (secondary wavelength = 700 nm) is measured. This is an endpoint reaction that is specific for glucose. Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods used. There were no changes to the lab site or lab method for this component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle. There were no changes to the lab equipment since 2015-2016. The Cobas C311 analyzer was used in 2017-2018 and 2015-2016. Refer to analytic note for changes to equipment in earlier survey cycles, which may impact analysis.
