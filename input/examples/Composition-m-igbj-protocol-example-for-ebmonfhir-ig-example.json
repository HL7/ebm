The glucagon component of LY900018 is a synthetic single-chain, 29-amino-acid polypeptide identical to human glucagon. LY900018 is being developed for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia. \nCurrently, glucagon in a liquid form lacks physical and chemical stability; thus, marketed products require reconstitution of glucagon powder before the product can be administered through intramuscular (IM) injection. LY900018 combines stable, synthetic glucagon and a nasal dosing device that for effective use obviates reconstitution, injection, and moreover, patient inhalation. Because of these advantages, LY900018 may offer a significant improvement in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia occurring outside of the hospital setting. \nThe aim of this study is to compare LY900018 with IM glucagon (IMG), a currently approved product that requires reconstitution prior to administration through IM injection, in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who achieve treatment success during controlled insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Treatment success is defined as an increase in plasma glucose (PG) to \u226570 mg/dL or an increase of \u226520 mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional treatments to increase PG. The nadir is defined as the minimum PG measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The design and conduct of Study IGBJ are similar to the completed Phase 3 Study I8R-MC-IGBC (IGBC) (Rickels et al. 2016) and the planned Phase 1 Study I8R-MC-IGBI.</div>"}}, {"title": "Assessment of Risks and Benefits", "code": {"text": "section2.2-benefits-risks"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No text is intended here (header only).]</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Risk Summary and Mitigation Strategy", "code": {"text": "section2.2.1-risk-summary"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No text is intended here (header only).]</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Trial-specific Intervention Risks and Mitigations", "code": {"text": "section2.2.1.1-trial-intervention-risk-summary"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">2.2.2\tRisk Summary and Mitigation Strategy\nThis study will expose patients to an insulin-induced hypoglycemia meant to simulate hypoglycemia in a controlled setting. The procedure of insulin-induced hypoglycemia targeting nadir glucose around 50 mg/dL is adopted from a previously completed trial, specifically Study IGBC, which demonstrated the safe use of this method. This is an inpatient procedure in which the patients will be under constant supervision of the clinical research unit (CRU) staff with frequent glucose monitoring. Safety provisions have been considered in that IV glucose will be administered if the patient experiences signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia and gauged to require intervention during the experimental procedure, at the discretion of the investigator.   \nPotential risks associated with LY900018, derived from the known risks of currently existing injected glucagon therapy and from the safety profile observed from clinical trials conducted for LY900018, include nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, increased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, headache, dysgeusia, and nasal or ocular events (Glucagon G Novo for Injection Package Insert, 2016; Glucagon G Novo for Injection Interview Form, 2015; GLUCAGON for Injection ITO Package Insert, 2016; GLUCAGON for Injection ITO Interview Form, 2016). \nNausea and Vomiting: Glucagon therapy, including LY900018, may cause nausea and vomiting. \nAllergic Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with glucagon therapy, including LY900018. Patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to injectable glucagon, or LY900018 or any of its excipients will be excluded from all clinical studies. \nIncreased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Glucagon exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. A temporary increase in both BP and heart rate may occur after the administration of glucagon, including LY900018. \nHeadache and Dysgeusia: Use of LY900018 may cause headache and altered taste. \nNasal Symptoms: Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of nasal symptoms, such as runny nose, stuffy nose, nasal discomfort, cough, and sneezing. \nOcular Symptoms: Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of ocular symptoms, such as watery eyes, redness of eyes, and itchy eyes. \nNo additional potential risks of LY900018 were identified in preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies (Reno et al. 2015).</div>"}}, {"title": "Trial-specific Procedure Risks and Mitigations", "code": {"text": "section2.2.1.2-trial-procedures-risk-summary"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}], "text": "Optional section not used."}}, {"title": "Trial-specific Other Risks and Mitigations", "code": {"text": "section2.2.1.3-trial-other-risk-summary"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}], "text": "Optional section not used."}}]}, {"title": "Benefit Summary", "code": {"text": "section2.2.2-benefit-summary"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">2.2 Summary of Benefits and Risks\nHypoglycemia is a common complication in all patients with T1DM and some patients with T2DM who use insulin to reduce blood glucose levels. Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing  device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity. \nThree clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia. \nAll adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon. \nPatients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016)\n\n2.2.1\tBenefit Summary\nThere is no anticipated therapeutic benefit for the patients participating in this study\n</div>"}}, {"title": "Overall Risk-Benefit Assessment", "code": {"text": "section2.2.3-overall-benefit-risk-conclusion"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs), and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of LY900018 are to be found in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB). \nMore detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of GlucaGen\u00ae may be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (GlucaGen Summary of Product Characteristics, 2015). </div>"}}]}]}, {"title": "Trial Objectives and Associated Estimands", "code": {"text": "section3-estimands"}, "text": {"status": "generated", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><div><strong>Prmary Objectives and Associated Estimands</strong>\n    <p><strong>Name: </strong>Treatment success</p>\n    <p><strong>Description </strong>To demonstrate that 3 mg LY900018 is non-inferior to 1 mg IMG for the proportion of patients achieving treatment success from insulin-induced hypoglycemia using a non-inferiority margin of 10%</p>\n    <p><strong>Outcome Measures:</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Proportion achieving treatment success</strong></p>\n    <table>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n                <td>primary</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n                <td>The proportion of patients achieving treatment success defined as either an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir within 30 minutes after administration of glucagon.

Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator, single-dose, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover study in Japanese patients with T1DM and T2DM. The study consists of a screening period; treatment period 1 (Period 1); washout period; treatment period 2 (Period 2); follow-up period. Figure IGBJ.1 illustrates the study design. Prior to the study drug administration on Period 1 Day 1, patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence (either LY900018 in Period 1 and IMG in Period 2, or vice versa). \nSafety data will be reviewed after the first 6 patients (regardless of type of diabetes) are administered LY900018 in Period 2, and the remaining patients will be dosed after confirmation of the safety. The investigator and Lilly clinical research physician (CRP) or scientist will review available safety data, including AEs, SAEs, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory tests, from these patients after they complete Period 2 Day 1. If no clinically significant safety findings for treatment or study procedure are noted, the remaining patients will be dosed. \nIn each treatment period, patients will undergo a procedure to induce hypoglycemia using IV insulin infusion and serial blood sampling will be conducted to monitor bedside PG for safety. The insulin infusion will be stopped once the PG level reaches &lt;60 mg/dL and approximately 5 minutes later patients will be administered either 3 mg LY900018 or 1 mg IMG (GlucaGen). Serial blood sampling will be performed for glucagon (for pharmacokinetics [PK]) and PG (for pharmacodynamics [PD]) concentration measurements immediately before and up to 4 hours following the administration of glucagon. In each period, patients will remain in the CRU for at least 6 hours after glucagon administration. All patients will receive a carbohydrate-rich meal prior to discharge. Patients may stay longer as needed, at the discretion of the investigator.</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Stakeholder Input into Design", "code": {"text": "section4.1.1-stakeholder-input-into-design"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}], "text": "Optional section not used."}}]}, {"title": "Rationale for Trial Design", "code": {"text": "section4.2-rationale-for-trial-design"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No text is intended here (header only).]</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Rationale for Estimand(s)", "code": {"text": "section4.2.1-rationale-estimands"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}]}}, {"title": "Rationale for Intervention Model", "code": {"text": "section4.2.2-rationale-intervention-model"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This study design involves an open-label assessment of 3 mg LY900018 compared to 1 mg of the marketed IMG (GlucaGen). The study will be open label because the different administration routes (ie, intranasal and IM) cannot be blinded. The use of a crossover design allows each patient to serve as his or her own control, thereby reducing variability. The washout period of 3 to 14 days is considered sufficient based on the short half-life of LY900018 (t1/2 = approximately 25 minutes). Since the critical role of glucagon in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia is to raise the PG level sufficiently to restore cognition to the point where oral carbohydrate can be ingested, treatment success is defined either as an increase in PG returning to normal level of \u226570 mg/dL or an increase of \u226520 mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional actions to increase glucose. It is believed that an expected PG nadir of approximately 50 mg/dL (approximately 5 minutes after stop of insulin infusion at 60 mg/dL) is low enough to generate clinical symptoms in most participants and is high enough to avoid impairment of consciousness. The primary analysis includes both patients with T1DM and T2DM since it is expected that the proportion of treatment success is similar between patients with T1DM and T2DM.</div>"}}, {"title": "Rationale for Control Type", "code": {"text": "section4.2.3-rationale-comparator"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}]}}, {"title": "Rationale for Duration", "code": {"text": "section4.2.4-rationale-duration"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}]}}, {"title": "Rationale for Adaptive or Novel Trial Design", "code": {"text": "section4.2.5-rationale-adaptive"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}]}}, {"title": "Rationale for Interim Analysis", "code": {"text": "section4.2.6-rationale-interim-analysis"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}]}}, {"title": "Rationale for Other Trial Design Aspects", "code": {"text": "section4.2.7-rationale-other-aspects"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Not applicable</p></div>"}}]}, {"title": "Trial Stopping Rules", "code": {"text": "section4.3-trial-stopping-rules"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Not applicable.</div>"}}, {"title": "Start of Trial and End of Trial", "code": {"text": "section4.4-start-and-end"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) for the last patient.</div>"}}, {"title": "Access to Trial Intervention After End of Trial", "code": {"text": "section4.5-access-after-trial"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Patients will continue their previous insulin regimen after the study procedure has been complete</div>"}}]}, {"title": "Trial Population", "code": {"text": "section5-trial-population"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No text is intended here (header only).]</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Description of Trial Population and Rationale", "code": {"text": "section5.1-population-description"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Seventy-five patients may be enrolled in order to have at least 66 patients (at least 30 patients with T1DM and T2DM, respectively) complete the study.

This self-report assessment will be done using the Clarke Hypoglycemia Awareness Survey (Appendix 8).\n8.3.4\tInsulin-induced Hypoglycemia \nA study investigator, or qualified designee, must be present at the bedside for clinical assessments of the patient during the insulin infusion and for the 120 minutes following the glucagon administration. \nThe bedside PG level, measured using a glucose analyzer (Antsense Duo, HORIBA Ltd. or equivalent), must be 90 to 250 mg/dL to start the procedure. If the bedside PG is outside of this range, the hypoglycemia induction should be rescheduled. \nHypoglycemia will be induced by IV infusion of diluted human regular insulin (0.3 U/mL) at a rate of 2 mU/kg/min. The infusion rate may be adjusted as necessary up to a rate of 3 mU/kg/min for T1DM or 4 mU/kg/min for T2DM to decrease bedside PG levels &lt; 60 mg/dL; however, the rate of decrease in PG should not exceed 50 mg/dL per 30 minutes. When the bedside PG concentration reaches &lt;90 mg/dL, the insulin infusion rate may be decreased to approximately 1.0 mU/kg/min at the investigator\u2019s discretion. Once the bedside PG level is &lt;60 mg/dL, the insulin infusion will be stopped. If the target bedside PG level cannot be achieved within 4 hours after the start of insulin infusion, the hypoglycemia induction procedure will be terminated before glucagon administration, and the patient may have a carbohydrate-rich meal and be discharged from the CRU after medical assessment. Additional safety assessments may be conducted at the investigator\u2019s discretion. The patient may be rescheduled for a new dosing visit 1 to 7 days later.\nFor safety monitoring during the hypoglycemia induction procedure, bedside PG levels will be measured using the glucose analyzer no more than 10 minutes apart while PG is \u2265 90 mg/dL, and no more than 5 minutes apart when PG is &lt; 90 mg/dL. \nBlood samples will be collected at pre-hypoglycemia induction and end of insulin infusion (5 minutes prior to study treatment) for PG (PD, as measured by central laboratory) and/or glucagon (PK) measurements according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2).\n8.3.5\tGlucagon Administration \nApproximately 5 minutes after the insulin infusion has stopped, glucagon (either 3 mg LY900018 or 1 mg IMG) will be administered according to randomization. Refer to Section 7 for details regarding treatments.\n8.3.5.1\tNasal LY900018 Administration \nLY900018 will be administered by CRU staff with the patient lying in a fully reclined lateral position on the opposite side of the nostril being administered (ie, dose is given in the left nostril of a patient lying in right lateral recumbency). The tip of the drug product is gently entered in the nostril to the point where the index and middle finger of the administrator are just touching the external nare of the patient. At that point, the bottom of the drug product is pushed with the thumb until the device is engaged, the green band disappears, and powder is discharged into the nostril. The drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity; thus, the patient does not need to inhale after dosing and continues breathing normally throughout the process. If a patient sneezes immediately after administration, document using the Nasal and Non-nasal Score Questionnaire (see Appendix 6 for a copy of the questionnaire).\n8.3.5.2\tIntramuscular Glucagon Administration \nGlucaGen 1 mg for injection will be used as a comparator. The lyophilized 1 mg glucagon will be reconstituted with 1.1 mL diluent according to the instruction. A dose of 1 mg of glucagon in I8R-JE-IGBJ(a) Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 37 LY900018 a concentration of 1 mg/mL will be injected in the deltoid muscle of the patient\u2019s nondominant arm with the patient lying in a fully reclined lateral position on the opposite side of the arm being administered (ie, dose is given in the left arm of a patient lying in right lateral recumbency if right arm is the dominant arm).\n8.3.6\tPost Glucagon Administration \nFor 120 minutes after glucagon administration, bedside PG levels will be measured no more than 5 minutes apart when the PG is &lt; 90 mg/dL, and no more than 10 minutes apart when PG is \u2265 90 mg/dL using a glucose analyzer (Antsense Duo, HORIBA Ltd. or equivalent). \nBlood samples will be collected at predose and various time points post glucagon administration for PG (PD, as measured by central laboratory) and/or glucagon (PK) measurements according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). \nTo accurately capture the PG profile, the site should not give patients any calorie-containing food/drink within 90 minutes of glucagon administration unless there is a safety concern. \n8.3.7\tProcedures for Insufficient Response to Glucagon Administration \nIf the patient loses consciousness or the bedside PG is declining too fast or symptoms consistent with the progression to severe hypoglycemia occur, the investigator may decide to start a glucose infusion to prevent a deterioration of the situation. Following the administration of glucagon, if a patient\u2019s bedside PG concentration remains &lt; 55 mg/dL at 30 minutes or &lt; 60 mg/dL at 45 minutes postdose, IV glucose may be given as deemed clinically necessary. If IV glucose is given, the time and amount of glucose infusion will be recorded in the CRF.\n8.3.8\tEnd of Admission \nBefore discharge from the CRU, the glucose and insulin dosing and stability of the patient will be evaluated by the investigator to ensure patient safety. Patients will remain at the CRU for at least 6 hours following glucagon administration, during which time a carbohydrate-rich meal will be provided. The patient may stay at the CRU longer, at the discretion of the investigator</div>"}}, {"title": "Safety Assessments and Procedures", "code": {"text": "section8.4-safety-assessments"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No text is intended here (header only).]</div>"}, "section": [{"title": "Physical Examination", "code": {"text": "section8.4.1-physical-examination"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "unavailable", "display": "Unavailable"}], "text": "Optional section not used."}}, {"title": "Vital Signs", "code": {"text": "section8.4.2-vital-signs"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For each patient, vital sign measurements should be conducted according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). \nBody temperature will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3) and as clinically indicated. \nBlood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after at least 5 minutes supine. \nUnscheduled orthostatic vital signs should be assessed, if possible, during any AE of dizziness or posture-induced symptoms.

(This has also been called unclassifiable hypoglycemia.)\nDocumented Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia (Level 2)\nSimilar criterion as for Level 1, except for threshold PG &lt; 54 mg/dL\n\u2022\tLevel 2 documented symptomatic hypoglycemia \n\u2022\tLevel 2 documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia \n\u2022\tLevel 2 documented unspecified hypoglycemia\nSevere Hypoglycemia (Level 3) \nPatient had altered mental status and could not assist in their own care, was semiconscious or unconscious, or experienced coma with or without seizures, and the assistance of another person was to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of PG concentration to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration (PG \u2264 70 mg/dL)\nOther Hypoglycemia\n\u2022\tNocturnal hypoglycemia: Any documented hypoglycemic event (including severe hypoglycemia) that occurs at night and presumably during sleep. This is captured as hypoglycemia that occurs between bedtime and waking. This definition is more useful than the commonly used approximately 00:00 to 06:00 definition which does not take patients\u2019 individual sleep times into consideration, and is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations of reporting events that occur during sleep (ADA 2005). It is also important to collect the actual time when a hypoglycemic event occurred to allow further characterization of hypoglycemia timing (eg, to allow analysis of frequency of events occurring across a 24-hour clock). Nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur at severity Levels 1, 2, or 3.\n\u2022\tRelative hypoglycemia (also referred to as pseudohypoglycemia [Seaquist et al. 2013]): An event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia occur, that does not require the assistance of another person and is accompanied by PG \u2265 70 mg/dL. The PG value of patients with chronically poor glycemic control can decrease so rapidly that patients may report symptoms of hypoglycemia before their PG concentration falls below 70 mg/dL. Events with PG \u2264 70 mg/dL should not be categorized as relative hypoglycemia. Evaluation and statistical analysis of this category is optional. However, if a patient reports a relative hypoglycemia event  where assistance from another person was received or the patient experienced significant symptoms, the study team should clarify the circumstances to ensure the event is not a severe hypoglycemia event, and report it appropriately.\n\u2022\tProbable symptomatic hypoglycemia: Symptoms of hypoglycemia were present, but PG measurement was not reported. \n\u2022\tOverall (or total) hypoglycemia: This optional category combines most cases of hypoglycemia (documented hypoglycemia and probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia). It does not include relative hypoglycemia. Nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycemia. If an event of hypoglycemia falls into multiple subcategories, that event should only be counted once in the category of overall (or total) hypoglycemia. \nHypoglycemia episodes will be recorded on specific CRF pages. Only severe hypoglycemic episodes will be reported separately as AEs. If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars.

Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for glucagon will be calculated using standard noncompartmental methods of analysis (NCA). \nThe primary parameters for PK analysis will be maximal concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), and time to maximal concentration (Tmax) of glucagon. Other noncompartmental parameters, such as half-life, apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution, may be reported. \nThe following PK parameters will also be calculated using baseline-adjusted (ie, change from baseline) concentrations of glucagon: AUC, Cmax, and Tmax. Baseline glucagon concentrations will be concentrations from samples obtained immediately prior to glucagon dosing (ie, predose). \nParameters will be individually calculated for each patient based on actual time of collection. \n10.8.1.2\tPharmacokinetic Statistical Inference \nLog-transformed PK parameters (such as Cmax and AUC) will be evaluated in a linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects for treatment, period, and sequence, and a random effect for patient. The treatment differences will be back-transformed to present the ratios of geometric means and the corresponding 90% CIs. The Tmax will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Estimates of the median difference based on the observed medians, 90% CIs, and p-values from the Wilcoxon test will be calculated. Exploratory analyses may be performed for other PK parameters as deemed appropriate.\n10.8.2\tPharmacodynamic Analyses \n10.8.2.1\tPharmacodynamic Parameter Estimation \nPharmacodynamic parameters will be calculated using NCA. Key PD parameters will be derived to assess the exposure to glucose and duration of exposure above, below, and within the normal glucose range. The normal range for PG will be considered to be 70 to 108 mg/dL. Actual sampling times will be used for all calculations. \nThe following PD parameters will be calculated using concentrations of glucose: \nAUECabove \t\tarea under the effect concentration-time curve above the normal range \nAUECbelow \t\tarea under the effect concentration-time curve below the normal range \nAUECwithin \t\tarea under the effect concentration-time curve within the normal range \nAUEC0-1.5 \tarea under the effect concentration-time curve from time zero (predose) up to 1.5 hours\nBGmax \tmaximal plasma glucose concentration \nDurationabove \tduration above normal range \nDurationbelow \tduration below normal range \nDurationwithin \tduration within normal range \ntabove \ttime to concentrations above normal range \ntbelow \ttime to concentrations below normal range (after tabove) \ntwithin \ttime to concentrations within normal range \nTmax \ttime to maximal concentration \nThe following PD parameters will be calculated using change from baseline concentrations of PG: \nAUEC0-1.5 \tarea under the effect concentration-time curve from time zero (predose) up to 1.5 hours \nBGmax \tmaximal plasma glucose concentration \nTmax \ttime to maximal concentration\n\nBaseline PG concentrations will be concentrations from samples obtained immediately prior to glucagon dosing (ie, zero hour time point). \nOther PD parameters of PG may be calculated if required. Individual concentrations and PD parameters of PG will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment. The patients who receive IV glucose up to 90 minutes postdose will be excluded from the summary statistics. \n10.8.2.2\tPharmacodynamic Statistical Inference \nThe PD parameters (such as BGmax and AUEC) will be log-transformed prior to analysis and a linear mixed-effects model fitted to the data, with treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. For each parameter, the treatment difference will be back-transformed to present the ratios of geometric means and the corresponding 90% CIs. \nThe values of Tmax will be analyzed nonparametrically using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Median differences and approximate 90% CIs for the difference will be calculated for the comparisons of treatments. \nExploratory analyses may be performed for other PD parameters as deemed appropriate.\n10.8.3\tPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses \nExploratory analyses may be performed to evaluate exposure-response relationship if needed. \n10.8.4\tEvaluation of Immunogenicity \nThe frequency and percentage of patients with preexisting (baseline) ADA, ADA at any time point after baseline, and patients with TE ADA to glucagon may be tabulated.  \nTreatment-emergent ADA are defined as those with a titer 2-fold (1 dilution) greater than the minimum required dilution of the assay, if no ADA were detected at baseline; or those with a 4-fold (2 dilutions) increase in titer compared to baseline, if ADA were detected at baseline. For patients with TE ADA, the distribution of maximum titers may be described. The frequency of neutralizing antibodies may also be tabulated. \nThe relationship between the presence of antibodies to glucagon and efficacy, PK parameters, PD response, and safety results may be assessed. \n10.8.5\tData Review During the Study \nAccess to safety data is scheduled to occur after the first 6 patients complete Period 2 Day 1.
