Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggests that this sample size has 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p<.05, twosided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. \n\nGroup mean changes from baseline in the primary efficacy parameters will serve as efficacy criteria.\n\nThe primary analysis of efficacy will include only the data obtained up to and including the visit of discontinuation of study drug. Furthermore, the primary analysis will not include efficacy data obtained at any visit where the study drug was not administered in the preceding three days. Analyses that include the retrieved dropouts are considered secondary. In general, all patients will be included in all analyses of efficacy if they have a baseline measurement and at least one postrandomization measurement.\n\nThe primary analysis of ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ will be the 24-week endpoint, which is defined for each patient and variable as the last measurement obtained postrandomization (prior to protocol defined reduction in dose). a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF). Note that the LOCF analysis at 24 weeks is the same as the endpoint analysis described previously. \n\nThe primary method to be used for the primary efficacy variables will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Effects in the ANCOVA model will be the corresponding baseline score, investigator, and treatment. Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full model prior to conducting the primary ANCOVA (see description below). Because 3 treatment groups are involved, the primary analysis will be the test for linear dose response in the ANCOVA model described in the preceding paragraph. The result is then a single p-value for ADAS-Cog. \n\nInvestigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full ANCOVA or ANOVA model, which takes the models described above, and adds the interaction term to the model. Interaction will be tested at \u03b1 = .10 level. When the interaction is significant at this level, the data will be examined for each individual investigator to attempt to identify the source of the significant interaction. When the interaction is not significant, this term will be dropped from the model as described above, to test for investigator and treatment main effects. By doing so, all ANCOVA and ANOVA models will be able to validly test for treatment differences without weighting each investigator equally, which is what occurs when using Type III sums of squares (cell means model) with the interaction term present in the model. This equal weighting of investigators can become a serious problem when sample sizes are dramatically different between investigators. \n\nFor all ANOVA and ANCOVA models, data collected from investigators who enrolled fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be combined prior to analysis. If this combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with the next fewestenrolling investigator. In the event that there is a tie for fewest-enrolling investigator, one of these will be chosen at random by a random-number generator.\n\nThe inherent assumption of normally distributed data will be evaluated by generating output for the residuals from the full ANCOVA and ANOVA models, which include the interaction term, and by testing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from PROC UNIVARIATE. In the event that the data are predominantly nonnormally distributed, analyses will also be conducted on the ranked data. This rank transformation will be applied by ranking all the data for a particular variable, across all investigators and treatments, from lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 1; mean ranks will be assigned when ties occur. \n\nAll comparisons between xanomeline and placebo with respect to efficacy variables should be one-sided. The null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative\nhypothesis is that the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. \n\nDifferent regulatory agencies require different type I error rates. Treatment differences that are significant at the .025 \u03b1-level will be declared to be \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d When a computed p-value falls between .025 and .05, the differences will be described as \u201cmarginally statistically significant.\u201d This approach satisfies regulatory agencies who have accepted a one-sided test at the .05 level, and other regulatory agencies who have requested a two-sided test at the .05 level, or equivalently, a one-sided test at the .025 level. In order to facilitate the review of the final study report, two-sided p-values will be presented in addition to the one-sided p-values."}], "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>[No data.]</p></div>"}, "extension": [{"url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ebm/StructureDefinition/artifact-publication-status", "valueCodeableConcept": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/cited-artifact-status-type", "code": "active", "display": "Active"}]}}], "citeAs": "ADAS-Cog(11) EndpointAnalysisPlan from PHUSE Lilly Redacted Protocol - EBMonFHIR IG Version [Database Entry: FHIR Evidence Resource].
