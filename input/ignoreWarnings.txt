# Suppressing the warning about adding jurisdiction element to Resources because jurisdiction element is deprecated.
The resource should declare its jurisdiction to match the package id (hl7.fhir.uv.ebm, jurisdiction = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001: 'World') (for Sushi users: in sushi-config.yaml, 'jurisdiction: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001 "World"')

# Suppressing the warnings about reference to jurisdiction elements (now deprecated) becuase errors in IG Publisher if jurisdiction elements are not present.
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# Suppressing message that a CodeSystem property has a code without a URI; these properties were used in a DataDictionary Profile where these properties are not precisely terminology concepts
This property has only a code ('Datatype') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
This property has only a code ('Units') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem

# Suppressing message that a slice is not found in a base Profile (but it is used in a derivative Profile) in a Resource mapped to 2 Profiles
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ebm/StructureDefinition/evidence-report-package|1.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

#Suppressing a message about XML tags in markdown. This is a known issue converting structured abstract data from MEDLINE and is handled in the presentation of the data.
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<A'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'OB'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'BA'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
