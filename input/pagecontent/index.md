Welcome to the EBMonFHIR Implementation Guide!

The FHIR Resources for Evidence Based Medicine Knowledge Assets ('EBMonFHIR') Implementation Guide defines profiles and value sets for the representation of scientific knowledge. This implementation guide is intended for developers of systems using FHIR for data exchange of scientific knowledge and for authors of more specialized implementation guides in this domain.

This implementation guide covers the broad scope of representation of scientific knowledge, including (1) citations to represent identification, location, classification, and attribution for knowledge artifacts; (2) research results including the statistic findings, definition of variables for which those findings apply, and the certainty of these findings; (3) assessments of research results; (4) aggregation and synthesis of research results; (5) judgments regarding evidence syntheses and contextual factors related to recommendations; (6) recommendations; and (7) compositions of combinations of these types of knowledge. The types of interoperability covered include syntactic (Resource StructureDefinitions) and semantic (value sets).
