Patients who were discharged from the hospital before day 21 were assumed to be alive and free of organ support through day 21. Any death during the index hospitalization through 90 days was assigned the worst score on the outcome scale (\u20131). This end point reflects both the use of ICU-level interventions and survival, with higher values indicating better outcomes.", "resourceType": "EvidenceVariable", "name": "Organ_support_free_days"}
