# Suppressing the warning about adding jurisdiction element to Resources because jurisdiction element is deprecated.
The resource should declare its jurisdiction to match the package id (hl7.fhir.uv.ebm, jurisdiction = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001: 'World') (for Sushi users: in sushi-config.yaml, 'jurisdiction: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001 "World"')

# Suppressing the warnings about reference to jurisdiction elements (now deprecated) becuase errors in IG Publisher if jurisdiction elements are not present.
