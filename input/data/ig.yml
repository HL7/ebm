      events among 2,219 participants with known outcome out of 2,244 enrolled participants.
      The probability of superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin
      was 98.6%. The risk of bias in this effect estimate is of extremely serious
      concern based on a serious concern for confounding covariate bias (confounding

      blinding of intervention deliverers who may determine the outcome based in part

      \ of interest were obese, adult (age \u226518 years old) patients, Intervention\
      \ was bariatric surgery, Controls were obese patients who did not undergo bariatric\
      \ surgery, and Outcomes were defined as all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and\
      \ incidence of CV disease, i.e. incident AF, incident HF, incident myocardial\
      \ infarction, incident stroke, and incident aortic stenosis. Further, for clarity\
      \ reasons we investigated myocardial infarction, and not incident coronary artery\
      \ disease, because it is very difficult if not impossible to define its onset,\
      \ also this was not uniform across the studies. Somewhat similarly, we investigated\
      \ stroke and not incident cerebrovascular disease. A few studies, however, further\
      \ differentiated between ischaemic vs. haemorrhagic stroke, and thus we also\
      \ separately investigated the effect on ischaemic stroke."
