### Understanding the Composition Resource

The <b>Composition Resource</b> is a structure for grouping information for purposes of persistence and attestability. The <b>Composition Resource</b> provides the basic structure for a FHIR document. The full content of the document is expressed using a <b>Bundle Resource</b> containing the Composition and its entries (which are references to other FHIR Resources).

Metadata elements in the <b>Composition Resource</b> that are similar to other Resources include url, identifier, version, status (which has different codes than the status used in other Resources), date, useContext, author (which uses a Reference datatype), name, title, and note.

Composition.type is required and uses a CodeableConcept datatype. Composition.category is optional and uses an array of CodeableConcept datatype.

Composition.subject is optional and uses an array of Reference to express what the composition is about. Composition.encounter is optional and uses a single Reference to an Encounter Resource (this is common in health data exchange and uncommon in science data exchange).

Composition.attester is a repeatable BackboneElement that is similar conceptually to reviewer, editor, and endorser elements used in other Resources.

Composition.custodian is optional and references an <b>Organization Resource</b> to represent the 'publisher' of the composition.

Composition.relatesTo is similar to Resource.relatedArtifact used in other Resources. In compositions used for scientific knowledge exchange, there is often a desire to inform the reader how to cite the composition. The relatesTo element may have an instance with a type of "cite-as" to represent how to cite the composition. In FHIR R6, the RelatedArtifact datatype was deprecated and Composition.relatesTo became a BackboneElement including type 1..1 code and target[x] 1..1 uri or canonical or Reference or Attachment or markdown.

Composition.event is a repeatable BackboneElement to represent the clinical service(s) being documented and is not expected to be used commonly in the EBMonFHIR Implementation Guide.

Composition.section is a repeatable and recursive BackboneElement that contains all the content of the composition.

Identifiers of a composition section include section.title (string datatype), section.code (CodeableConcept datatype), and section.focus (Reference datatype).

Metadata about the composition section include section.author (repeatable Reference datatype) and emptyReason (CodeableConcept datatype).

The content of a section may be found in text, entry, and/or section elements.

section.entry is a repeatable Reference.

section.section is a repeatable BackboneElement and section.orderedBy is a CodeableConcept to specify the order of section entries.

section.text is a Narrative datatype used for a text summary of the section. A Narrative datatype contains 2 required elements: section.text.status coded as generated, extensions, additional, or empty and section.text.div with xhtml content.

### EvidenceReport Profile of Composition Resource

The **[EvidenceReport Profile][EvidenceReport]** is used for a base structure (canonical resource management) for a report combining any number of <b>Citation</b>, <b>Evidence</b>, <b>EvidenceVariable</b>, <b>Composition</b>, and related Resources. The **[EvidenceReport Profile][EvidenceReport]** adds a number of extensions for metadata (versionAlgorithm, experimental, description, purpose, copyright, copyrightLabel, approvalDate, lastReviewDate, and effectivePeriod). The Composition.attester.mode element uses a CodeableConcept datatype and a Contributor Role Value Set is provided with preferred binding to include concepts for reviewer, editor, endorser, informant, recorder, and funder. The Composition.relatesTo element includes extensions (targetUri, targetCanonical, targetReference, targetAttachment, targetMarkdown) until these elements are included in the base FHIR R6 specification used for this implementation guide. An EvidenceReport Section Code Value Set is provided with extensible binding for the section.code elements.
