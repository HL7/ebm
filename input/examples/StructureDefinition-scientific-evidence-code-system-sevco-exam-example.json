During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid Phase 2 studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.

[MeSH 2014_2014_02_10]\n\nfrom INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HARMONISATION OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS FOR HUMAN USE (ICH HARMONISED GUIDELINE) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CLINICAL STUDIES E8(R1) https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E8-R1_Guideline_Step4_2021_1006.pdf Adopted on 6 October 2021\n\n4.3.1 Human Pharmacology\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early\nclinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans\n(usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nparticipants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease,\ndepending on drug properties and the objectives of the development programme.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\n4.3.1.1 Estimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine\nthe tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to\ndetermine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include\nboth single and multiple dose administration.\n\n4.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics\nCharacterisation of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues\nthroughout the development programme, but the preliminary characterisation is an essential\nearly goal. Pharmacokinetic studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the\ndrug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with\nmetabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some\npharmacokinetic studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialised\nquestions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is\nimportant to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining pharmacokinetic\ninformation in sub-populations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as\npatients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups\nshould be considered (ICH E4 Dose-Response Studies, E7 Clinical Trials in Geriatric\nPopulation, E11, and E5, respectively).\n\n4.3.1.3 Pharmacodynamics & Early Measurement of Drug Activity\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic studies and studies\nrelating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nparticipants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure,\npharmacodynamic data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the\ndosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\n\nfrom March 1998 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/ich-e-8-general-considerations-clinical-trials-step-5_en.pdf\n\n3.1.3.1 Phase I (Most typical kind of study: Human Pharmacology)\nPhase I starts with the initial administration of an investigational new drug into humans.\nAlthough human pharmacology studies are typically identified with Phase I, they may also be\nindicated at other points in the development sequence. Studies in this phase of development\nusually have non-therapeutic objectives and may be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects\nor certain types of patients, e.g. patients with mild hypertension. Drugs with significant\npotential toxicity, e.g. cytotoxic drugs, are usually studied in patients. Studies in this phase\ncan be open, baseline controlled or may use randomisation and blinding, to improve the\nvalidity of observations.\nStudies conducted in Phase I typically involve one or a combination of the following aspects:\na) Estimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability\nThe initial and subsequent administration of an investigational new drug into humans is\nusually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be needed for later\nclinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These\nstudies typically include both single and multiple dose administration.\nb) Pharmacokinetics\nCharacterisation of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues\nthroughout the development plan. Their preliminary characterisation is an important goal of\nPhase I. Pharmacokinetics may be assessed via separate studies or as a part of efficacy, safety\nand tolerance studies. Pharmacokinetic studies are particularly important to assess the\nclearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites\nand potential drug-drug interactions. Some pharmacokinetic studies are commonly conducted\nin later phases to answer more specialised questions. For many orally administered drugs,\nespecially modified release products, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important.\nObtaining pharmacokinetic information in sub-populations such as patients with impaired\nelimination (renal or hepatic failure), the elderly, children, women and ethnic subgroups\nshould be considered. Drug-drug interaction studies are important for many drugs; these are\ngenerally performed in phases beyond Phase I but studies in animals and in vitro studies of\nmetabolism and potential interactions may lead to doing such studies earlier.\nc) Assessment of Pharmacodynamics\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint studied, pharmacodynamic studies and studies\nrelating drug blood levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nsubjects or in patients with the target disease. In patients, if there is an appropriate measure,\npharmacodynamic data can provide early estimates of activity and potential efficacy and may\nguide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies. \nd) Early Measurement of Drug Activity\nPreliminary studies of activity or potential therapeutic benefit may be conducted in Phase I as\na secondary objective. Such studies are generally performed in later phases but may be\nappropriate when drug activity is readily measurable with a short duration of drug exposure in\npatients at this early stage."}, {"code": "comment", "valueString": "Phase 1 trials are often the first step in testing a new treatment in humans and may include safety assessment, measurement of metabolism and pharmacologic actions of a drug in humans, or the side effects associated with increasing doses.

These studies are often intended to provide an adequate basis for marketing approval, and to support adequate instructions for use of the drug and official product information. They aim to evaluate the drug in participants with or at risk of the condition or disease who represent those who will receive the drug once approved. This may include investigating subgroups of patients with frequently occurring or potentially relevant comorbidities  (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatic and renal impairment) to characterise the safe and effective use of the drug in patients with these conditions. \n\nConfirmatory studies may evaluate the efficacy and safety of more than one dose or the use of the drug in different stages of disease or in combination with one or more other drugs. If the intent is to administer a drug for a long period of time, then studies involving extended exposure to the drug should be conducted (ICH E1 Clinical Safety for Drugs used in Long-Term Treatment). Irrespective of the intended duration of administration, the duration of effect of the drug will also inform the duration of follow-up.\n\nStudy endpoints selected for confirmatory studies should be clinically relevant and reflect disease burden or be of adequate surrogacy for predicting disease burden or sequelae. \n\nfrom March 1998 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/ich-e-8-general-considerations-clinical-trials-step-5_en.pdf\n\n3.1.3.3 Phase III (Most typical kind of study: Therapeutic Confirmatory)\nPhase III usually is considered to begin with the initiation of studies in which the primary objective is to demonstrate, or confirm therapeutic benefit.\nStudies in Phase III are designed to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated in Phase II that a drug is safe and effective for use in the intended indication and recipient population.

Studies in Phase III may also further explore the dose-response relationship, or explore the drug's use in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or in combination with another drug. For drugs intended to be administered for long periods, trials involving extended exposure to the drug are ordinarily conducted in Phase III, although they may be started in Phase II (see ICH E1).

There are many new software tools which apply quantitative methods to qualitative studies.\nQuantitative and qualitative have categorical results I believe\nDisagree - (Sorry, maybe you already know my comment here ;>). From my experience, qualitative analysis produces more than descriptive or categorical results, and uses a range of essential complex methodologies for producing unattainable results from trials. Some methods are inductive, others are deductive, or a mix of both. This modify the results achievable. For example, phenomenology from categorical codes produces new understanding of people's lived experiences (deemed robust, even from a small but convenient sample of people), whereas grounded theory, from descriptive and categorical data results, discovers or creates novel theories, crucial for subsequent research scrutiny, even for a trial. \nI would suggest to define qualitative analysis differently = A study design process in which data, analysed and coded to produce descriptive and categorical results, lead to new understanding of people's lived experiences or new theories, unattainable from quantitative studies, essential for future trials.\nIn my opinion, descriptive numerical results come from quantitative analysis also (for example, incidence of SARS-COV2 per 100.000 habitants). I am not an expert in qualitative research but I guess it tackles phenomenons which can be observed but not measured.\n\n2022-05-24 comment: Qualitative analysis provide a description or summary to understand exploratory experiences and patterns, themes in the data which can provide the framework for additional data interpretation through other analysis such as quantitative analysis.  An example of a qualitative method is focus groups.

(Model development studies only)\n\nA data set will often have many features that could be used as candidate predictors, and in many studies researchers want to reduce the number of predictors during model development to produce a simpler model.\n\nIn a univariable analysis, individual predictors are tested for their association with the outcome. Researchers often select the predictors with a statistically significant univariable association (for example, P < 0.05) for inclusion in the development of a final prediction model. This method can lead to incorrect predictor selection because predictors are chosen on the basis of their statistical significance as a single predictor rather than in context with other predictors (49, 50, 191). Bias occurs when univariable modeling results in omission of variables from the model, because some predictors are important only after adjustment for other predictors, known from previous research to be important, did not reach statistical significance in the particular development set (for example, due to small sample size). Also, predictors may be selected on the basis of a spurious (accidental) association with the outcome in the development set.\n\nA better approach to decide on omitting, combining, or including candidate predictors in multivariable modeling is to use nonstatistical methods\u2014that is, methods without any statistical univariable pretesting of the associations between candidate predictors and outcome. Better methods include those based on existing knowledge of previously established predictors in combination with the reliability, consistency, applicability, availability, and costs of predictor measurement relevant to the targeted setting. Well-established predictors and those with clinical credibility should be included and retained in a prediction model regardless of any statistical significance (49, 50, 192). Alternatively, some statistical methods that are not based on prior statistical tests between predictor and outcome can be used to reduce the number of modeled predictors (for example, principal components analysis)."}, {"code": "approval", "valueString": "2022-07-29 vote 5-0 by Janice Tufte, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Jesus Lopez-Alcalde, Harold Lehmann, Eric Harvey"}]}], "definition": "An analysis bias due to inappropriate choice of variables included in the analysis before the analysis is applied.", "property": [{"code": "editors", "valueString": "Brian S.

The same percentage (96%) applies for full-text articles. \n2022-12-16 comments: Delete comma in definition (before \"that\"). \np-hacking and fishing expedition aren't synonyms but data processes leading to bias. \"p-hacking induced bias\" maybe"}, {"code": "negative-vote", "valueString": "2022-12-09 votes 4-0 by Yuan Gao, Mario Tristan, Eric Harvey, Harold Lehmann\n2022-12-16 votes 6-1 by Philippe Rocca-Serra, Janice Tufte, Yuan Gao, Jesus Lopez-Alcalde, Mario Tristan, Eric Harvey, Harold Lehmann"}, {"code": "approval", "valueString": "2022-12-23 vote 6-0 by Joanne Dehnbostel, Harold Lehmann, Yuan Gao, Jesus Lopez-Alcalde, Mario Tristan, Eric Harvey"}], "designation": [{"use": {"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "900000000000013009", "display": "Synonym (core metadata concept)"}, "value": "p-hacking"}, {"use": {"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "900000000000013009", "display": "Synonym (core metadata concept)"}, "value": "Fishing expedition"}, {"use": {"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "900000000000013009", "display": "Synonym (core metadata concept)"}, "value": "Data snooping bias"}, {"use": {"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "900000000000013009", "display": "Synonym (core metadata concept)"}, "value": "p-hacking bias"}, {"use": {"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "900000000000013009", "display": "Synonym (core metadata concept)"}, "value": "Fishing expedition bias"}]}, {"code": "SEVCO:00322", "display": "final model not corresponding to multivariable analysis", "definition": "An analysis bias in which the predictors and coefficients in the final model do not match the predictors and coefficients reported in the multivariable analysis.", "property": [{"code": "external-definitions", "valueString": "from PROBAST:\n4.9 Do predictors and their assigned weights in the final model correspond to the results from the reported multivariable analysis? (Model development studies only)\n\nPredictors and coefficients of the final developed model, including intercept or baseline components, should be fully reported to allow others to correctly apply the model to other individuals. Mismatch between the presented final model and the reported results from the multivariable analysis (such as the intercept and predictor coefficients) is frequent. A review of prediction models in cancer in 2010 found that only 13 of 38 final prediction model equations (34%) used the same predictors and coefficients as the final presented multivariable analyses, 8 used the same predictors but different coefficients, 11 used neither the same coefficients nor the same predictors, and 6 used an unclear method to derive the final prediction model from the presented results of the multivariable analysis (121).\n\nBias can arise when the presented final model and the results reported from the multivariable analysis do not match. One way this can occur is when nonsignificant predictors are dropped from a larger model to arrive at a final presented model but the predictor coefficients from the larger model are used to define the final model, which are no longer correct. When predictors are dropped from a larger model, it is important to reestimate all predictor coefficients of the smaller model because the latter has become the final model. These newly estimated predictor coefficients are likely different even if nonsignificant or irrelevant predictors from the larger model are dropped.\n\nWhen a study reports a final model in which both predictors and regression coefficients correspond to the reported results of the multivariable regression analysis or model, this question should be answered as Y. If the final model is based only on a selection of predictors from the reported multivariable regression analysis without refitting the smaller model, it should be answered as N or PN. When no information is given on the multivariable modeling from which predictors and regression coefficients are derived, it should be answered as NI.\n\nThis signaling question is not about detecting improper methods of selecting predictors for the final model; such methods are addressed in signaling question 4.5."}, {"code": "comment", "valueString": "This type of bias is applicable to model development studies and model selection within other study designs."}, {"code": "editors", "valueString": "Kenneth Wilkins, Brian S.

It helps the assessor judge whether results are likely to be spurious or biased because of analysis or reporting. To make this judgment, the assessor considers the data presented to determine the adequacy of the analytic strategy and model-building process and investigates concerns about selective reporting. Selective reporting is an important issue in prognostic factor reviews because studies commonly report only factors positively associated with outcomes. A study would be considered to have low risk of bias if the statistical analysis is appropriate for the data, statistical assumptions are satisfied, and all primary outcomes are reported.\nROB2 = This domain addresses bias that arises because the reported result is selected (based on its direction, magnitude or statistical significance) from among multiple intervention effect estimates that were calculated by the trial investigators. We call this bias in selection of the reported result. Consideration of risk of bias requires distinction between:\n\u2022 An outcome domain. This is a state or endpoint of interest, irrespective of how it is measured (e.g. severity\nof depression);\n\u2022 An outcome measurement. This is a specific way in which an outcome domain is measured (e.g. measurement of depression using the Hamilton rating scale 6 weeks after starting intervention); and \n\u2022 An outcome analysis. This is a specific result obtained by analysing one or more outcome measurements (e.g. the difference in mean change in Hamilton rating scale scores from baseline to 6 weeks between experimental and comparator groups). This domain does not address bias due to selective non-reporting (or incomplete reporting) of outcome domains that were measured and analysed by the trial investigators (115). For example, deaths of trial participants may be recorded by the trialists, but the reports of the trial might contain no mortality data, or state only that the intervention effect estimate for mortality was not statistically significant. Such bias puts the result of a synthesis at risk because results are omitted based on their direction, magnitude or statistical significance. It should therefore be addressed at the review level, as part of an integrated assessment of the risk of reporting bias (116).\nROBINS-I = Bias in selection of the reported result"}, {"code": "editors", "valueString": "Brian S.

In contrast, \"risk\" refers to the probability that an event will occur. \n\nMathematically;\n\"Conditional probability\" is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred. Let us have two events, A and B, and we want to know P(A) given P(B); notationally, P(A|B). Here the word 'given' defines a subset of the population of events because it applies condition on B. For example, if we care about the incidence of COVID-19 in men only, we might want to know P(COVID-19 | male). This means that first, pick out all the males, and second, figure out the probability they will get COVID-19. More formally, what P(A|B) says is: pick out the events to which both P(A) and P(B) apply and consider them as part of the subset of events to which only P(B) applies: hence P(A/B) = P(A and B)/P(B).\nIn simple words, what we are doing with P(A|B) = P(A and B) | P(B) is selecting out the same subset of the event population in both the\nthe numerator and the denominator: in this case, only men.\nWhile \"risk\" by definition involves no condition. Taking the same example, we can say, \"what is the risk of COVID-19?\" here, we refer to the whole population; however, we can apply can make a condition over it like \"what is the risk of COVID-19 in males?\" This risk may be taken as \"conditional risk,\" and it could be taken as an alternative term to conditional probability.  \nConclusion: Let us define two terms, \"risk\" and \"conditional risk,\" as a subset of \"risk.\" Then \"conditional probability\" shall be taken as an alternative term to \"conditional risk.\"\nOne more important point about the current definition of \"Risk,\" i.e., \nRisk = A proportion in which the numerator represents the probability that an event or characteristic occurs and the denominator represents the probability that the event or characteristic occurs or does not occur.\nIf we write symbolically, it will look like this; P(A)/P(A or B), where A indicates \"positive,\" which is the occurrence of something, and B indicates \"negative,\" which is the non-occurrence of the same. We can write it formally as P(A) / P(AUB). In set theory, when there is \"OR,\" in other words, \"Union\" infer the True value when either of them is True. It means A is true, or B is true, or both are true; we will get the true result. Interestingly, occurrence and non-occurrence are mutually exclusive, so two situations arise.\nI) when the event occurs: P(A) / P(AUB)  --> P(A)/P(A) = 1\nII) when the event does not occur: P(A) / P(AUB)  --> P(A)/P(B)  = Odds\nTherefore the definition needs to be revised for the correct meaning of the denominator.

(I can think of 3 questions regarding these cases. (1) Are they defined? (2) Is p=1 the same as \u221e. (3) Does 3:0=1:0?)\n\nWe should mention that this term does not include gambling odds. (As I understand it, gambling odds are the ratio of stake to winnings with several representations and frequently have a \"rounding\" factor to ensure a profit for the bookmaker).\n\nAnother issue is whether to represent \"Odds Against\" in the vocabulary. It could come up when annotating an immutable pre-existing source that gives odds as odds against; for example, an NLP system that scans published works to output labels for sections of the text.\n\nA term related to \"Odds\" missing from the parent branch, \"Ratio,\" is \"Log Odds.\"\n(Not unique to this term, but I noticed it here) The children of \"Statistic\" should inherit the application comment from \"Statistic\" about distinguishing between the statistic and statistic value. That way, a reader will not need to read the whole tree to know that 1.5 is not \"Odds\"; it is \"Odds statistic value.\" (However, I do not see a place for \"Odds statistic value\" in the tree.)\n\nFinally, the repetition of \"Odds may be expressed as\" is awkward.\n\n2022-02-23 comments: \"Odds may be expressed as p:(1-p). Odds may be expressed as p:q where q = 1-p. \" Sounds redundant.\nalternative terms: Probablity likelihood, chance ---{{Group meeting decided that 'probability' and 'likelihood' are terms we may consider adding to the SEVCO but they are not alternative terms for odds, 'chance' is considered a lay term and not a specific statistical term for the code system}}\nOdds is a computational function such as addition, subtraction, multiplication.  Odds Ratio may be better term for the term definition.

A person-time rate is generally calculated from a long-term cohort follow-up study, wherein enrollees are followed over time and the occurrence of new cases of disease is documented. Typically, each person is observed from an established starting time until one of four \u201cend points\u201d is reached: onset of disease, death, migration out of the study (\u201clost to follow-up\u201d), or the end of the study. Similar to the incidence proportion, the numerator of the incidence rate is the number of new cases identified during the period of observation. However, the denominator differs. The denominator is the sum of the time each person was observed, totaled for all persons. This denominator represents the total time the population was at risk of and being watched for disease. Thus, the incidence rate is the ratio of the number of cases to the total time the population is at risk of disease.\n\n\nalternative terms for incidence rate (incidence density, average hazard) noted at https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/eks/formula_sheet.pdf"}, {"code": "negative-vote", "valueString": "2022-05-11 vote 7-1 by Eric Harvey, raradhikaag@gmail.com, Jesus Lopez-Alcalde, Mario Tristan, Janice Tufte, Harold Lehmann, Paola Rosati, Robin Ann Yurk"}, {"code": "expert-comments", "valueString": "2022-05-11 comment: Suggest improving current term definition with the definition in comment for application.

In cancer research, odds ratios are most often used in case-control (backward looking) studies to find out if being exposed to a certain substance or other factor increases the risk of cancer. For example, researchers may study a group of individuals with cancer (cases) and another group without cancer (controls) to see how many people in each group were exposed to a certain substance or factor. They calculate the odds of exposure in both groups and then compare the odds. An odds ratio of one means that both groups had the same odds of exposure and, therefore, the exposure probably does not increase the risk of cancer. An odds ratio of greater than one means that the exposure may increase the risk of cancer, and an odds ratio of less than one means that the exposure may reduce the risk of cancer. (NCI)\nThe ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a sample-based estimate of that ratio. (NCI)\n\nNICE: Compares the odds (probability) of something happening in 1 group with the odds of it happening in another. An odds ratio of 1 shows that the odds of the event happening (for example, a person developing a disease or a treatment working) is the same for both groups. An odds ratio of greater than 1 means that the event is more likely in the first group than the second. An odds ratio of less than 1 means that the event is less likely in the first group than in the second group."}, {"code": "statistical-purpose", "valueString": "Measure of Association"}, {"code": "approval", "valueString": "2022-03-16 vote 8-0 by Mario Tristan, Paola Rosati, Louis Leff, nisha mathew, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Harold Lehmann, Janice Tufte, Eric Moyer"}], "definition": "A measure of association that is the ratio of two odds."}, {"code": "TBD:0000028", "display": "Prevalence Ratio", "property": [{"code": "statistical-purpose", "valueString": "Measure of Association"}, {"code": "external-definitions", "valueString": "https://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/PrevalenceRatio#:~:text=Reference-,Definition%20of%20Prevalence%20Ratio,the%20proportion%20with%20the%20exposure.\nThe ratio of the proportion of the persons with disease over the proportion with the exposure.\n\nCalculation is described here:\nhttps://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH717-QuantCore/PH717-Module3-Frequency-Association/PH717-Module3-Frequency-Association12.html"}, {"code": "comment", "valueString": "Prevalence (SEVCO STATO:0000412) is defined as: A proportion in which the numerator represents all events of interest (for example, both new and preexisting cases of a disease) in the population, which is represented by the denominator.\n\nThe Prevalence Ratio indicates the magnitude of the prevalence of an event/outcome in one group of subjects/individuals (with characteristics/attribute) relative to another group (with different characteristics/attributes), such as the prevalence of the disease among the exposed persons to the prevalence of the disease among the unexposed persons."}, {"code": "editors", "valueString": "Brian S.

It does so by dividing the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 1 by the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 2. The two groups are typically differentiated by such demographic factors as sex (e.g., males versus females) or by exposure to a suspected risk factor (e.g., did or did not eat potato salad).
