{"resourceType": "EvidenceVariable", "title": "Organ support-free days", "status": "active", "description": "The primary outcome was organ support\u2013free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. Patients who were discharged from the hospital before day 21 were assumed to be alive and free of organ support through day 21. Any death during the index hospitalization through 90 days was assigned the worst score on the outcome scale (\u20131). This end point reflects both the use of ICU-level interventions and survival, with higher values indicating better outcomes.", "note": [{"text": "Organ support was defined as oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or the use of vasopressors or inotropes."}, {"text": "The methods for one of the included trials stated 'Organ Support is defined as receipt of invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal oxygen, vasopressor therapy, or ECMO support'"}], "handling": "ordinal", "publisher": "Computable Publishing LLC", "copyright": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "contact": [{"telecom": [{"system": "email", "value": "support@computablepublishing.com"}]}], "date": "2022-03-07T00:50:50.578Z", "meta": {"versionId": "6", "lastUpdated": "2023-12-01T16:35:08.324Z"}, "url": "https://fevir.net/resources/EvidenceVariable/7753", "id": "7753", "identifier": [{"type": {"text": "FEvIR Object Identifier", "coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203", "code": "ACSN", "display": "Accession ID"}]}, "system": "https://fevir.net", "value": "7753", "assigner": {"display": "Computable Publishing LLC"}}], "author": [{"name": "Brian S.
