These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nparticipants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease,\ndepending on drug properties and the objectives of the development programme.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\n4.3.1.1 Estimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine\nthe tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to\ndetermine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include\nboth single and multiple dose administration.\n\n4.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics\nCharacterisation of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues\nthroughout the development programme, but the preliminary characterisation is an essential\nearly goal. Pharmacokinetic studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the\ndrug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with\nmetabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some\npharmacokinetic studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialised\nquestions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is\nimportant to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining pharmacokinetic\ninformation in sub-populations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as\npatients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups\nshould be considered (ICH E4 Dose-Response Studies, E7 Clinical Trials in Geriatric\nPopulation, E11, and E5, respectively).\n\n4.3.1.3 Pharmacodynamics & Early Measurement of Drug Activity\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic studies and studies\nrelating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nparticipants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure,\npharmacodynamic data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the\ndosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\n\nfrom March 1998 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/ich-e-8-general-considerations-clinical-trials-step-5_en.pdf\n\n3.1.3.1 Phase I (Most typical kind of study: Human Pharmacology)\nPhase I starts with the initial administration of an investigational new drug into humans.\nAlthough human pharmacology studies are typically identified with Phase I, they may also be\nindicated at other points in the development sequence. Studies in this phase of development\nusually have non-therapeutic objectives and may be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects\nor certain types of patients, e.g. patients with mild hypertension. Drugs with significant\npotential toxicity, e.g. cytotoxic drugs, are usually studied in patients. Studies in this phase\ncan be open, baseline controlled or may use randomisation and blinding, to improve the\nvalidity of observations.\nStudies conducted in Phase I typically involve one or a combination of the following aspects:\na) Estimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability\nThe initial and subsequent administration of an investigational new drug into humans is\nusually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be needed for later\nclinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These\nstudies typically include both single and multiple dose administration.\nb) Pharmacokinetics\nCharacterisation of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues\nthroughout the development plan. Their preliminary characterisation is an important goal of\nPhase I. Pharmacokinetics may be assessed via separate studies or as a part of efficacy, safety\nand tolerance studies. Pharmacokinetic studies are particularly important to assess the\nclearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites\nand potential drug-drug interactions. Some pharmacokinetic studies are commonly conducted\nin later phases to answer more specialised questions. For many orally administered drugs,\nespecially modified release products, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important.\nObtaining pharmacokinetic information in sub-populations such as patients with impaired\nelimination (renal or hepatic failure), the elderly, children, women and ethnic subgroups\nshould be considered. Drug-drug interaction studies are important for many drugs; these are\ngenerally performed in phases beyond Phase I but studies in animals and in vitro studies of\nmetabolism and potential interactions may lead to doing such studies earlier.\nc) Assessment of Pharmacodynamics\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint studied, pharmacodynamic studies and studies\nrelating drug blood levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer\nsubjects or in patients with the target disease. In patients, if there is an appropriate measure,\npharmacodynamic data can provide early estimates of activity and potential efficacy and may\nguide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies. \nd) Early Measurement of Drug Activity\nPreliminary studies of activity or potential therapeutic benefit may be conducted in Phase I as\na secondary objective. Such studies are generally performed in later phases but may be\nappropriate when drug activity is readily measurable with a short duration of drug exposure in\npatients at this early stage."}, {"code": "comment", "valueString": "Phase 1 trials are often the first step in testing a new treatment in humans and may include safety assessment, measurement of metabolism and pharmacologic actions of a drug in humans, or the side effects associated with increasing doses.

It usually occurs with the passing of time before a subject initiates a given exposure. While a subject is not truly immortal during this time span, the subject necessarily had to remain event free until start of exposure to be classified as exposed. An incorrect consideration of this unexposed time period in the design or analysis will lead to immortal time bias.\n\nin JAMA https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2776315\nSuch studies may be subject to immortal time bias, meaning that, during the period of observation, there is some interval during which the outcome event cannot occur\n\nin https://watermark.silverchair.com/dyab157.pdf\nIn particular, incorrect handling of follow-up times in terms of exposure status in the analysis of such studies may introduce immortal time bias (ITB) in favour of the exposed group.2,3 Immortal time refers to a period of time in which, by design, participants in the exposed group cannot experience the outcome. This often  happens in pharmacoepidemiologic studies in which treatment is prescribed at variable times (with delay) after disease diagnosis. The bias occurs when the exposed group is considered to be exposed during their entire follow-up time (even during periods in which they are theoretically unexposed) or their unexposed follow-up times are discarded.2,3"}, {"code": "approval", "valueString": "2022-07-22 vote 7-0 by Mario Tristan, Paul Whaley, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Harold Lehmann, Jesus Lopez-Alcalde, Janice Tuft, Eric Harvey"}]}, {"code": "SEVCO:00293", "display": "Inadequate sample size", "definition": "A bias related to selection of the analytic framework in which the sample size invalidates the assumptions of the analytic framework.", "property": [{"code": "comment", "valueString": "An example of 'Inadequate sample size' is a finding of no effect with inadequate power to detect an effect.
