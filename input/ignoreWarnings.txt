# Suppressing warnings about using tooling from version 5.0.0 for a version 6.0.0-ballot2 because version 6.0.0 tooling not available
This IG is version 6.0.0-ballot2, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r5' is from version 5.0.0
This IG is version 6.0.0-ballot2, while the IG 'hl7.terminology.r5' is from version 5.0.0
This IG is version 6.0.0-ballot2, while the IG 'hl7.fhir.uv.tools.r5' is from version 5.0.0
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 6.0.0-ballot2 but package hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r5#5.2.0 is based on FHIR version 5.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
