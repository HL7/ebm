# Suppressing the warning about adding jurisdiction element to Resources because jurisdiction element is deprecated.
The resource should declare its jurisdiction to match the package id (hl7.fhir.uv.ebm, jurisdiction = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001: 'World') (for Sushi users: in sushi-config.yaml, 'jurisdiction: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm#001 "World"')

# Suppressing the warnings regarding binding to Medication Ingredient Strength Codes for Medication.ingredient.strengthQuantity as this appears to be relevant to strengthCodeableConcept and an artifact of strength[x] misapplication in the generation of warnings
The code provided (http://unitsofmeasure.org#mg) is not in the value set 'Medication Ingredient Strength Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/medication-ingredientstrength|6.0.0-ballot3), and a code is recommended to come from this value set

# Suppressing message that a slice is not found in a base Profile (but it is used in a derivative Profile) in a Resource mapped to 2 Profiles
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ebm/StructureDefinition/evidence-report-package|1.0.0-ballot2 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ebm/StructureDefinition/research-study-data-dictionary|1.0.0-ballot2 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# Suppressing warnings about the content of an actual ValueSet used for example purposes, as this was based on a real ValueSet that we are not able to revise
No definition can be found for the system http://fhir.de/CodeSystem/bfarm/icd-10-gm, and the property 'child' is not a generally known property, so the property might not be valid, or understood by the terminology ecosystem. In case it's useful, the list of generally known properties for all systems is concept,code,status,inactive,effectiveDate,deprecationDate,retirementDate,notSelectable,synonym,comment,itemWeight

# Suppressing a message about XML tags in markdown. This is a known issue converting structured abstract data from MEDLINE and is handled in the presentation of the data.
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<A'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
