Primary hypothesis: As compared to non-surgical treatment, bariatric surgery will be associated with higher rates of remission, and lower rates of new-onset drug treated hypertension during a follow-up period of \u2264 10 years.\n    2. Secondary hypotheses: Changes in the usage of other drugs, particularly drugs related to obesity related comorbidities, will differ significantly between patients undergoing bariatric surgery or non-surgical treatment during the follow-up period. </p>\n<p><b>Study Design:</b> Observational research (coded as: SEVCO:01002 from https://fevir.net/sevco); Parallel cohort design (coded as: SEVCO:01011 from https://fevir.net/sevco); Longitudinal data collection (coded as: SEVCO:01028 from https://fevir.net/sevco)</p></div>"}, "entry": [{"reference": "ResearchStudy/208285", "type": "ResearchStudy", "display": "Norwegian Cohort Study Comparing Bariatric Surgery vs Medical Obesity Treatment for Long-term Medical Complications and Obesity-Related Comorbidities"}]}, {"title": "Methods Section", "code": {"coding": [{"system": "https://fevir.net/resources/CodeSystem/179423", "code": "methods", "display": "Methods"}]}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">[No data.]</div>"}, "emptyReason": {"coding": [{"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/list-empty-reason", "code": "notstarted", "display": "Not Started"}]}}, {"title": "Baseline Measures", "code": {"coding": [{"system": "https://fevir.net/resources/CodeSystem/179423", "code": "baseline-measures", "display": "Baseline Measures"}], "text": "Baseline Measures"}, "text": {"status": "empty", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>[No data.]</p></div>"}, "entry": [{"reference": "List/312201", "type": "List", "display": "BaselineVariablesList: Association of Bariatric Surgery vs Medical Obesity Treatment With Long-term Medical Complications and Obesity-Related Comorbidities (2018 Norwegian Cohort)"}]}, {"title": "Baseline Characteristics", "code": {"text": "Baseline-Characteristics"}, "text": {"status": "additional", "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>As compared with medical patients, surgically treated patients were significantly younger with a higher BMI.
